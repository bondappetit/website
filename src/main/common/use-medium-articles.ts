      '\n<h3>Artem Tolkachev on the latest developments of BondAppetit</h3>\n<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artemtolkachev/">Artem Tolkachev</a>, and I am the co-founder and a leader of the <a href="https://bondappetit.io/">BondAppetit </a>team. I would like to address a few issues that being raised by the BondAppetit community.</p>\n<p>1. The price of BAG is quite volatile and will remain so for the time being. It is a normal phenomenon and is to be expected for any DeFi protocol at such an early stage of development. The protocol was launched only 4 days ago. Inflation is inevitable, as we are distributing a great amount of tokens. Keeping the price high is currently not among our priorities, we’re focusing on long-term goals. However, we are now working on a solution that may help stabilize the price of BAG — I will be able to provide more clarity in the next few days.</p>\n<p>As we have explicitly outlined in our whitepaper, we are now at launch Phase 1. At this stage, the BondAppetit governance token is backed by future expectations. We need some time to raise funding, which will then be used to buy the first batch of real-world assets (low-risk corporate bonds), and add them as collateral to the protocol.</p>\n<p>2. We do heed your feedback and understand your fears regarding the governance of the protocol. Given the risky nature of the crypto market, you have reason to be wary. I have been working on the crypto market since 2013. And the most important thing I understood is that money is not scarce. There is an over-abundance of money in the world. The world is literally swimming in cash. One just needs to know how to attract it. <strong>What is really scarce in crypto is reputation. I value my reputation, and I do not want to put it at risk in any way.</strong> Neither do other members of our team or our advisors. So at this stage, our reputation is the major risk prevention factor.</p>\n<p>At the same time keeping control of the protocol is not in the interest of the team. Truly decentralized solutions are the most valuable assets on the market. That is one of the reasons why we’re making such a huge distribution of governance tokens during these 3 month.</p>\n<p>3. In the next two weeks, we will be conducting an AMA session with me in our <a href="https://t.me/BondAppetitEn">Telegram chat</a> and on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/DvYurR4AS6">Discord server</a>.

      '\n<p><strong>The first DeFi protocol with a stablecoin fully backed by real-world assets with fixed periodic income</strong></p>\n<p>Today, we’re delighted to announce the public launch of <a href="https://bondappetit.io/">BondAppétit</a>, a DeFi protocol for business loans. BondAppétit is based on the Ethereum blockchain and provides an infrastructure that connects decentralized finance and traditional debt instruments with the participation of regulated securities and cryptocurrency brokers/dealers.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NuoEmVt-cnnCet0Iq2_Tyw.jpeg"></figure><h3>The Purpose of BondAppétit</h3>\n<h4>For crypto investors</h4>\n<p>BondAppétit will be the <strong>first and the only DeFi protocol with a stablecoin fully backed by real-world assets with fixed periodic income (bonds)</strong>. Unlike most other DeFi protocols, there will be <strong>real fiat cash flows </strong>inside the protocol.</p>\n<p>The price of the BondAppétit native stablecoin (USDap) equals $1 at all times. The token is issued only if the protocol has sufficient collateral.</p>\n<h4>For borrowers</h4>\n<p>Businesses are always looking for cheap financing opportunities. Traditionally, large and mid-sized companies get money through bank and bond financing. With its global reach and intermediary-free environment, the crypto market could become a new source of funding in the near future. The total market capitalization of the crypto market overcame the $1.7 trillion mark and is expected to grow.</p>\n<p>However, in its current state (as of April 2021) the DeFi lending market is a poor choice for established businesses. Most protocols suffer from high fees, volatility, and over-collateralization, making them uncompetitive for mid-sized and large businesses in comparison to traditional bank and bond financing.</p>\n<p>BondAppétit is determined to deal with these issues and open up new opportunities for businesses to access for a whole new source of liquidity.</p>\n<h3>How BondAppétit works</h3>\n<a href="https://medium.com/media/4dd8532f9922d285142ae65f94ac947d/href">https://medium.com/media/4dd8532f9922d285142ae65f94ac947d/href</a><p>The main asset inside the protocol’s ecosystem is the native stablecoin BondAppétit USD (USDap). The price of USDap is at a constant ratio of 1 to 1 with the US Dollar, and is always backed by sufficient collateral.The price of USDap is balanced automatically based on a basket of real-world debt obligations that form part of the protocol’s assets. Information regarding the collateral can be checked through blockchain at any time.</p>\n<p>The governance of the protocol is exercised by the holders of the BondAppétit Governance tokens (BAG). BAG holders are entitled to make all key decisions regarding BondAppétit. In order to enforce certain actions, a simple majority of token holders must vote for a certain proposal.</p>\n<p>The process of borrowing is built in the most convenient manner for borrowers and is in compliance with regulatory and financial requirements, as well as the conclusion of an appropriate agreement. Borrowers can receive funds in fiat as well as in crypto. For a detailed description, check chapter 4.3 (‘Borrowing process’) in the <a href="https://bondappetit.io/whitepaper">Whitepaper</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Protocol Launch Phases</h3>\n<p>BondAppétit will be launched in 3 phases, each phase with its own goal:</p>\n<h4>Phase 1. Investment Stage (April — July 2021)</h4>\n<p>At the first phase, our goals will be:</p>\n<p><strong>Attracting enough liquidity for USDap on Uniswap</strong>. Users will be able to invest USDC in the protocol by locking up their funds for a 3-month period. As a reward for this action, the protocol will distribute 5% of the initial BAG offering to all participants of the first phase.</p>\n<p>Later, at Phase 2, users will be able to convert these USDap back to USDC at the exchange rate of 0.999 USDap to 1 USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>Raising funds</strong>. The investment process will be structured through an offering of BAGs on the open market. The protocol aims to attract $1.2M. $1M will be used for the purchase of RWA and $200,000 will cover the client’s expenses for fiat/crypto and crypto/fiat conversions and technical expenses or the protocol (oracles maintenance).</p>\n<h4>Phase 2. RWA Collateralization (July 2021–2023)</h4>\n<p>After raising funds, the protocol will initiate the next stage. The first RWA will be purchased, and the protocol will collateralize these assets, which will strengthen USDap and will offer the first truly RWA-backed stablecoin on the market. Also, at this stage, the protocol will start receiving profits and distribute coupon payments from holding the RWA to BAG token holders.</p>\n<h4>Phase 3. Direct Investment (Q1 2023)</h4>\n<p>The last stage of the protocol’s launch. We expect that the protocol’s capitalization will reach $100M at this point. No more BAG tokens will be issued to the open market at this phase.</p>\n<p>Users will be able to purchase USDap directly from the protocol and us on the open market. This will increase the popularity of the protocol, due to an increase in rewards, as no more BAG will be issued.</p>\n<h3>How to Make Money on BondAppétit</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to profit on BondAppétit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Staking</strong>. Users can lock their crypto in the protocol to receive rewards.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Investing in BondAppétit governance</strong> <strong>token</strong>. BAG tokens will be in limited supply, leading to a positive correlation in their value with the growth of the protocol’s user base and its liquidity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>BondAppétit was audited by <a href="https://mixbytes.io/">MixBytes</a>, a reputable tech company providing top-notch blockchain solutions, smart contract security audits and tech advisory. The security of the protocol is our highest priority. We invest significant effort to make it safe.</p>\n<h3>How to Start Using BondAppétit</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href="https://bondappetit.io/">https://bondappetit.io/</a>, connect your wallet, buy some USDap and/or BAG, and stake them in one of the <a href="https://bondappetit.io/staking">liquidity pools</a>.</p>\n<p>Be advised that 5% of all governance tokens reserved for protocol’s usage will be distributed as a staking reward in the first 3 months for Phase 1 investors only.</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<p>Website: <a href="https://beta.bondappetit.io/">https://bondappetit.io/</a><br>Whitepaper: <a href="https://bondappetit.io/whitepaper">https://bondappetit.io/whitepaper</a><br>Litepaper: <a href="https://bondappetit.io/static/media/bondappetit_litepaper.pdf">https://bondappetit.io/static/media/bondappetit_litepaper.pdf</a> <br>Dev docs: <a href="https://bondappetit.io/docs/">https://bondappetit.io/docs/</a><br>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/BondAppetitEn">https://t.me/BondAppetitEn</a><br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFiBonds">https://twitter.com/DeFiBonds</a></p>\n<img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=bbb7fb2d20e5" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr>\n<p><a href="https://medium.com/bondappetit/bondappetit-is-now-live-bbb7fb2d20e5">BondAppetit is now live</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/bondappetit">BondAppetit</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>\n',

The total market capitalization of the crypto market overcame the $1.7 trillion mark and is expected to grow.</p>\n<p>However, in its current state (as of April 2021) the DeFi lending market is a poor choice for established businesses. Most protocols suffer from high fees, volatility, and over-collateralization, making them uncompetitive for mid-sized and large businesses in comparison to traditional bank and bond financing.</p>\n<p>BondAppétit is determined to deal with these issues and open up new opportunities for businesses to access for a whole new source of liquidity.</p>\n<h3>How BondAppétit works</h3>\n<a href="https://medium.com/media/4dd8532f9922d285142ae65f94ac947d/href">https://medium.com/media/4dd8532f9922d285142ae65f94ac947d/href</a><p>The main asset inside the protocol’s ecosystem is the native stablecoin BondAppétit USD (USDap). The price of USDap is at a constant ratio of 1 to 1 with the US Dollar, and is always backed by sufficient collateral.The price of USDap is balanced automatically based on a basket of real-world debt obligations that form part of the protocol’s assets. Information regarding the collateral can be checked through blockchain at any time.</p>\n<p>The governance of the protocol is exercised by the holders of the BondAppétit Governance tokens (BAG). BAG holders are entitled to make all key decisions regarding BondAppétit. In order to enforce certain actions, a simple majority of token holders must vote for a certain proposal.</p>\n<p>The process of borrowing is built in the most convenient manner for borrowers and is in compliance with regulatory and financial requirements, as well as the conclusion of an appropriate agreement. Borrowers can receive funds in fiat as well as in crypto. For a detailed description, check chapter 4.3 (‘Borrowing process’) in the <a href="https://bondappetit.io/whitepaper">Whitepaper</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Protocol Launch Phases</h3>\n<p>BondAppétit will be launched in 3 phases, each phase with its own goal:</p>\n<h4>Phase 1. Investment Stage (April — July 2021)</h4>\n<p>At the first phase, our goals will be:</p>\n<p><strong>Attracting enough liquidity for USDap on Uniswap</strong>. Users will be able to invest USDC in the protocol by locking up their funds for a 3-month period. As a reward for this action, the protocol will distribute 5% of the initial BAG offering to all participants of the first phase.</p>\n<p>Later, at Phase 2, users will be able to convert these USDap back to USDC at the exchange rate of 0.999 USDap to 1 USDC.</p>\n<p><strong>Raising funds</strong>. The investment process will be structured through an offering of BAGs on the open market. The protocol aims to attract $1.2M. $1M will be used for the purchase of RWA and $200,000 will cover the client’s expenses for fiat/crypto and crypto/fiat conversions and technical expenses or the protocol (oracles maintenance).</p>\n<h4>Phase 2. RWA Collateralization (July 2021–2023)</h4>\n<p>After raising funds, the protocol will initiate the next stage. The first RWA will be purchased, and the protocol will collateralize these assets, which will strengthen USDap and will offer the first truly RWA-backed stablecoin on the market. Also, at this stage, the protocol will start receiving profits and distribute coupon payments from holding the RWA to BAG token holders.</p>\n<h4>Phase 3. Direct Investment (Q1 2023)</h4>\n<p>The last stage of the protocol’s launch. We expect that the protocol’s capitalization will reach $100M at this point. No more BAG tokens will be issued to the open market at this phase.</p>\n<p>Users will be able to purchase USDap directly from the protocol and us on the open market. This will increase the popularity of the protocol, due to an increase in rewards, as no more BAG will be issued.</p>\n<h3>How to Make Money on BondAppétit</h3>\n<p>There are two ways to profit on BondAppétit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Staking</strong>. Users can lock their crypto in the protocol to receive rewards.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Investing in BondAppétit governance</strong> <strong>token</strong>. BAG tokens will be in limited supply, leading to a positive correlation in their value with the growth of the protocol’s user base and its liquidity.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>BondAppétit was audited by <a href="https://mixbytes.io/">MixBytes</a>, a reputable tech company providing top-notch blockchain solutions, smart contract security audits and tech advisory.
