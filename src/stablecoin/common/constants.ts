    title: 'Which assets are used as collateral of USDp?',
    body: [
      `The main assets of the protocol are debt obligations assumed by the borrowers.`,
      `USDp is issued only when a new borrower originates a loan in the protocol.
      Currently, the protocol lends money only to intermediaries which fulfill certain conditions.`,
      `Intermediaries then lend money to the ultimate borrowers under
      classic lending agreements, which require borrowers to provide collateral.
      The collateral ensures that the borrower will pay to the intermediary,
      and intermediary will pay to the protocol.`,
      `If the borrower fails to pay, the collateral is sold by the intermediary allowing it to repay its debt to the protocol.`,
      `Fixed income securities (bonds) are accepted by the intermediaries as a collateral under their agreements with the borrowers.`
